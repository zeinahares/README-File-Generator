## Description

I wanted to create a README Generator to simplify the process of writing a README. Now, you don't have to worry about markdown syntax, creating a table of contents, and finding the description of the license you're using. The generator will do that for you!

## Installation
You will need to have node.js installed on your computer.
Once you have that installed, after you clone the code, you will need to run 'npm install' in the your terminal to install the program's dependencies. Then, you can run the program using 'node index.js'.

## Usage

When you run the program using 'node index.js', you will get a series of prompts. These promps will ask for the project name, description, and all elements involved in a README file. Type your answer according to the question and press enter to submit your answer and go the next question. For the License question, you have a list of choices. Use your arrow keys to go through the selections, and once you are selecting the license you want with the arrow, press enter to confirm your choice. Once you answer all questions, a markdown file is generated with the name of the project you entered. Some Licence descriptions need a year and owner name. Make sure after the file is created, to check the license description and alter the date [yyyy] and owner [name of copyright owner] name accordingly.

Here's a link to a walkthrough video of the program: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lvF-f12XGyAAjLYjvgFpaqQF9t86O9EI/view
